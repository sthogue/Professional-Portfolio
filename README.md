# Professional Portfolio

Stephen Hogue's professional portfolio

## Description
This code is the provides a basic professional portfolio layout and structure. 

It highlights my current work as a student in a Web design and coding Bootcamp. 

The top of the navigation bar, you have nav links to the about me, works, and contact me section within the page. There are two external links that will take the user to my current resume and LinkedIn profile.

## Credit
I used [WAVE - Web Accessability Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to ensure the contrast between colors meets AAA standards

Complementary colors were chosen with the help of [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com)

Starter code was provided by the [HTML boilerplate VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vaisrav.samplext).

Inspiration was brought on by the EdX in class activities and examples.
